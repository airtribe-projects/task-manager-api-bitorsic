# Task Manager API

A simple in-memory task management API built with Express.js. It supports basic CRUD operations and includes optional filtering by completion status and task priority.

## üöÄ Overview

This API allows you to:

-   Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks
    
-   Filter tasks by their completion status
    
-   Retrieve tasks based on their priority (low, medium, high)
    

Tasks are stored in-memory using a `Map` and initialized from `task.json` when the server starts.
